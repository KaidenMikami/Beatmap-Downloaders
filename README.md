# Beatmap-Downloaders

Just some python files for automatically downloading osu beatmaps

Autosotarks is for you, r/osugame
(downloads all sotarks beatmaps you don't have)

You need the requests library (```pip install requests```)

Getlatestranked.py is currently a little buggy, but it should work.
(It is supposed to download all the latest ranked beatmaps you don't have)
